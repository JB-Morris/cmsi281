While the lists all had shared methods, I didn't see much of a purpose in implementing an interface as they all went about implementing those methods in different ways, so methods in an abstract base class or interface would just have to be overwritten.

I chose a Linked List for my third implementation because it allows for constant time when adding or removing elements while the array becomes more process intensive.
